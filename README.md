# lightsolved

This program was created because in my computer,
Ubuntu always started with the brightness at max
so I made a little program that adds itself to
the .profile of my main user, and starts at
60% brightness instead


#Steps to follow

1. Make sure you have xbacklight program install on your Linux.
2. Give execution permissions to the script. (sudo chmod +x info)
3. Follow the instructions and read the comments of the script if anything looks weird.
